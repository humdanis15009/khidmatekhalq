        ZAKAAT: A Pillar of Compassion and Generosity

            Zakaat is one of the five pillars of Islam, an essential act of
            worship that involves giving a portion of one's wealth to those in
            need. It is an obligatory form of charity, designed to purify the
            wealth of the giver while supporting the less fortunate in society.
            Zakaat is typically set at 2.5% of a Muslim's savings and assets
            accumulated over the course of a year.

            The purpose of Zakaat is to promote social justice, reduce
            inequality, and strengthen the bonds of community. By fulfilling
            this duty, Muslims are reminded of the blessings they have received
            and are encouraged to share their wealth with those who are less
            fortunate.

            Through your generous contributions of Zakaat, we can work together
            to uplift the lives of those in need, providing them with food,
            shelter, education, and healthcare. Zakaat not only benefits the
            recipients but also purifies the heart and wealth of the giver,
            fostering a sense of compassion and humility.
